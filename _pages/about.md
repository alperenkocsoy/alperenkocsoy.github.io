I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Durham University, specializing in applied econometrics, labour economics, behavioural economics, and sports economics.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Hospitality Coordinator at UEFA.

I will be in the Sport Management Job Market for the 2024-2025 Academic Year.
