I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Durham University, specialising in applied econometrics, labour economics, behavioural economics, and sports economics. I empirically analyse data from sport competitions to understand human behaviour under specific conditions.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Hospitality Coordinator at UEFA.

I will be in the Sport Management Job Market for the 2024-2025 Academic Year.
