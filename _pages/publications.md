<!-- Referee Bias in Football: Actual and Expected Additional Time -->
<b>Referee Bias in Football: Actual and Expected Additional Time</b>
<br>
<em>
    This study introduces ball-in-play time as a novel variable to assess potential referee bias in football concerning the decision on additional time. I begin with calculating expected additional times using ball-in-play. Hence, any systematic difference between actual and expected additional time can be considered as 'bias' if the difference depends on the winner of the match. Utilising matches played behind closed doors during the Covid-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, I find a trend that referees exhibit a bias towards home teams, but crucially, only in the presence of fans. This suggests that social pressure, put by fans, significantly influences the decisions of individuals. Then, the study examines the post-pandemic period, exploring if referees could adjust to an impartial stance due to their experience during matches played behind closed doors. Regrettably, the propensity to favour home teams remains prevalent once fans return to the stadiums. The study further examines referee behaviour when there is a strength difference between the competing teams to investigate big or favourite team bias.
